# ðŸ§  Word Parse

> A quick, no-frills tool for dissecting word frequency and context.

**Word Parse** is a lightweight React app that breaks down any block of text into a **frequency-sorted word list**, along with the **surrounding context** (left and right neighbors) of each word, complete with counts.

## âœ¨ What It Does

Paste in any chunk of text and instantly get:

- ðŸ“Š **Word Frequency:** See how often each word appears  
- ðŸ§­ **Context Windows:** For each word, view the most common words that show up immediately *before* and *after* it  
- ðŸ—‚ **Sorted Breakdown:** Data is cleanly sorted and easy to scan

Itâ€™s like `ctrl+F` for linguists, writers, and anyone curious about patterns in language.
